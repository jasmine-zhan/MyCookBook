# MyCookBook
My Cookbook is a web application designed to help university students cook efficiently using the ingredients they already have at home. It offers personalized recipe suggestions that minimize food waste and reduce grocery costs â€” addressing the common challenge of balancing academics with healthy eating.
Unlike typical recipe apps that require every ingredient, My Cookbook introduces a threshold filter that suggests recipes based on a chosen percentage of ingredients on hand.

# Tech Stack:
Java, SpringBoot, SQL, UML

# Key Features:
- User authentication for secure access
- Fridge inventory management with expiry alerts
- Recipe filtering and saving based on ingredient availability
- Fast, intuitive interface optimized for desktop use

# Development and Design
The app was developed following defined functional and non-functional requirements, modeled through UML diagrams, data flow diagrams, and state charts. Testing included both back-end unit tests and front-end usability checks across major browsers.
